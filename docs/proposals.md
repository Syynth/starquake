# Proposals

Work that agents have proposed and the owner has not yet vetted. **Nothing here is a commitment.**
GitHub issues are for work the owner has chosen to do; this file is where candidates wait.

How it works:

- Agents add entries here (wave scope reviews, review findings, ideas noticed in passing). They
  do not file GitHub issues for proposed work.
- The owner vets an entry. A promoted entry becomes a GitHub issue and its status changes to
  `promoted #N`. A dropped entry stays, with status `dropped` and the reason.
- Small items that belong to an existing issue are folded into that issue as a comment, and
  listed under "Folded" so the trail survives.
- Keep entries short: what, why, where it came from, and a suggested label and milestone.

Statuses: `proposed`, `promoted #N`, `folded into ...`, `adopted`, `dropped: <reason>`.

## Work items

### From wave 2 (ledger: #22)

| Status | Proposal | Why | Suggested |
|---|---|---|---|
| promoted #63 | **chore(xtask): unused-dependency check in the gate**; drop the unused workspace `bitflags` | #39 removed the IPC crate's unused dependencies by hand, but nothing stops it recurring. `bitflags` is now unused in the root `[workspace.dependencies]`. | infra, M1 |
| promoted #64 | **chore(ipc): de-duplicate the request and reply builders** and the test-side assembler; export the domain limit constants | Duplicated buffer-write logic, inconsistent overflow behaviour (saturate in one place, `FieldOutOfRange` in another), a test assembler the request builder supersedes, and inline literals for the domain header limits. | area:ipc, M1 |
| promoted #65 | **docs: pin libnx as a reference** and verify the request builder's raw-size and domain conventions against it | The builder's size conventions are marked as guesses. libnx is not a pinned reference, and Eden only parses requests. | area:ipc, M1 |
| promoted #66 (trimmed: offline switch and revert titles; the scheduled run and cache budget are dropped for now) | **ci: cargo-deny operability**: a scheduled advisory run, a documented triage and ignore path, an offline switch for `cargo xtask ci`, GitHub's `Revert "..."` PR titles, and the macOS PR job's cache budget | A new advisory can turn `main` and every PR red with no code change; the gate now needs network access; the title check rejects GitHub's own revert titles; per-PR macOS caches count toward the 10 GB limit. | infra, M1 |
| promoted #67 | **infra: shared build-folder safety across worktrees** | During wave 2 a stale or sibling `xtask` binary ran under `cargo xtask ci` in one worktree, and mutated scratch copies left stale artifacts. | infra, M1 |
| promoted #68 (blocked on the owner installing devkitPro) | **test: a homebrew-built NSO/NPDM fixture** | Several loader facts stay unconfirmed without a real file: NSO hash flags, module-name words, the wildcard form, the ACID access-control base, and the ACI0-against-ACID rules. Overlaps the test strategy's homebrew fixture decision (#8). | area:loader, M1 |
| dropped: the merge queue now waits for PR checks; the self-hosted runner question is recorded in the test strategy spec | **decision: required-checks policy** | Branch protection is unavailable on this private repo (HTTP 403). The macOS PR job is path-filtered and may be absent, the merge queue must check the checks itself (wave 2 merged two PRs before their CI finished), and a move to squash merges would leave the PR-title check as the only subject enforcement. | owner, infra |
| folded into the `fsp-srv` trial slice (service framework spec, slice 6) | **feat(fs): port the path normaliser** (`fs_path_utility`) | RomFS `find_dir`/`find_file` reject non-normalised paths, so the file-system service needs normalisation that matches Eden's. #16 cited the source but did not port it. | area:loader, M2 |
| proposed | **feat(loader): ExeFS title loading and RomFS mount**, including the NCA container and the `path_hash` signedness question | The PFS0 and RomFS parsers are reachable only from tests. Titles need a seekable source from an NCA container, and hashing of bytes 0x80 and above is unsettled. | area:loader, M2 |
| folded into #33 | **feat(loader): expose the Switch 2 `RemoteMemorySize` word** (META 0x10) | Not exposed by NPDM parsing; Switch 2 process setup will probably need it. | area:loader, M2 |

### Folded into existing issues (wave 2)

- Validation call sites and the refuse-or-warn policy → #33.
- The virtual-to-physical core map and core count (4 or 6) → #9.
- Wiring the request builder into synthetic guests and golden traces → #8.
- Whether `proptest-regressions/` is committed → #38.

## House-rule candidates

Rules distilled from review findings. A vetted rule moves into `CLAUDE.md`; until then it is
passed to build agents as a provisional rule for the next wave.

### From waves 1 and 2 (vetted by the owner, 2026-11-11)

| Status | Rule |
|---|---|
| adopted | Every proptest block sets an explicit fixed seed. |
| adopted | Expectations come from the shipping constants, with boundary cases exactly at the limit. (Importing constants was already a rule.) |
| adopted | A parser that reads ordered fields gets a round-trip test that fails if two reads are swapped. |
| adopted | Unsourced layouts are marked as guesses; claims about reference behaviour cite the exact check; divergences are listed and pinned by a test; no blanket claims. |
| adopted | Arithmetic on untrusted sizes is checked for the whole extent; loops over untrusted structures are bounded by the structure walked. |
| adopted | No retries to hide a flaky test; negative tests assert exact errors; a test for a fix is run against the unfixed code first; PR claims are verified. (Watching a new test fail was already a rule.) |
| adopted | Don't duplicate logic across sibling modules. |
| adopted | The merge queue waits for a PR's own CI checks before merging. |
| dropped: a fact about the CPU backend, not a house rule; folded into #36 | Host writes into guest-executable memory do instruction-cache maintenance. |
| dropped: a one-off fix, already applied | Widen CI path filters to cover every input that can break the job. |
